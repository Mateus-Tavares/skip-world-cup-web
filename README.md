This project was created for the Skip the Dishes challenge for Vanhack's SÃ£o Paulo Event.

The project was inspired by the World Cup. My thinking was what can I build to help improve everybody's experience at the event. The conclusion I came to along with fellow developers was to improve the food and drink service for the event.

Customers could download an app and inform what seat they were in to nearby food and drink stalls, and place their order. They would then be able to follow their order as it is prepared and delivered to their seat.

Through a website employees at the stall would see orders as they came in and be able to change their status in real time. Once an order is done, a courier could deliver the food and upon coming back complete the order.

While this service was thought up to be used during the World Cup it could be improved and expanded to include order sporting events, and even be implemented in individual studiums.

My project is the website, where I designed it to be similar to the Trello app, as it's design is easy to use and has great readability. New orders will appear as they became in, with the seat number, the items ordered and total that the customer would have to pay.

The site has to be easy and fast to use as workers will have to update orders in real time, along with their other tasks. So my thinking was keep it simple with all the important information that the workers really need to know. Showing just the most important information and having great usability.
